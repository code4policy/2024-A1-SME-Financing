    <h1>Supporting Small Businesses through Economic Shocks</h1>
    <img src="images/U.S._Small_Business_Administration_logo.svg" alt="The Small Business Funding" />
    <p>In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal government and economists alike are evaluating the effectiveness of relief and funding allocated to American small businesses. In a rush to get funds out the door, policymakers made available hundreds of billions of dollars worth of loans, mostly on a first come first serve basis, and other significant funding allocated to states based on population. Such funding models neglected to target aid to small businesses in sectors most affected by the pandemic.</p>
    <p>To better plan for future economic shocks and support the efforts of the Small Business Administration, we aim to provide a repository for small business data for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>policymakers</li>
      <li>economists</li>
      <li>researchers</li>
      <li>funders</li>
    </ul>

    <p>working together to keep small businesses alive and accessible, so people in the United States can sustain their businesses. We believe providing this information, visualized to show patterns and trends, across an open platform is essential to ensuring transparency.</p>

    <p> The above navigation bar will take you to visualizations to better understand: the kinds of small businesses prevalent in each state; funding from both the Small Business Administration and private lenders leading up to, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic; and the rate of business formation.</p>
