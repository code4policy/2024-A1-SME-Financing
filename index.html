    <p>We are going to create a repository for funds allocation for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>economists</li>
  <li>researchers</li>
  <li>funders</li>
  <li>lobbyists</li>
</ul>

<p>working together to keep small businesses alive and accessible, so people in the US can sustain their businesses. We believe this information across an open platform is essential to ensuring transparency.</p>
