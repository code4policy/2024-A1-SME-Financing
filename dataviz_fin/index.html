    <h1>Historical Funding Patterns</h1>  
    <h2>Approved Loan Values</h2>

    <p><b>The Small Business Administration (SBA)</b>'s primary funding mechanisms to small businesses has been through its <b>7(a)</b> and <b>504 programs</b>.</p>
    <p><b>The 7(a) program</b> is SBA's primary business loan program for providing financial assistance to small businesses. It provides loan guaranties to lenders (maximum value $5 million) so small businesses can go about:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Acquiring, refinancing, or improving real estate and buildings</li>
        <li>Short- and long-term working capital</li>
        <li>Purchasing and installation of machinery and equipment</li>
        <li>Purchasing furniture, fixtures, and supplies</li>
        <li>Changes of ownership (complete or partial)</li>
        <li>Multiple purpose loans, including any of the above</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>The 504 Loan Program</b> provides long-term, fixed rate financing for major fixed assets that promote business growth and job creation. These are available through Certified Development Companies (CDCs), SBA's community-based partners who regulate nonprofits and promote economic development within their communities. The maximum loan amount for a 504 loan is $5.5 million, with no more than 3 projects totaling $16.5 million.</p>
    <p>Understanding the trend of funding prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and during will help the SBA understand the impact of the economic shock of COVID and whether the stimulus provided in other forms (Paycheck Protection Program loans, Economic Injury Disaster Loans, Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, etc.) was sufficient to help small businesses weather the storm.</p>
