1. Datasets:

from https://www.census.gov/econ_datasets/

2. Convert the files to State/Industry based csv files
Used the following python coding:
- "make_by_state_rev.py"
- "make_by_industry_rev.py"

3. Manual adjustments (as indicated memos in the .py files)
- I manually replaced the rows/columns using Microsoft Excel

- I also manually renamed the name of the columns, reflecting the comments at the presentation of Sprint 1 that the names should not be based on the actual NAICS codes but their readible names.
(e.g. "NAICS22"ã€€-> "Utilities")
