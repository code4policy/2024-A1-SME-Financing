    <h1>What Are The Most Common Types of Small Businesses in Each State?</h1>
    
    <p>As a snapshot of the small business landscape of each state, we have pulled data from the US Census Bureau's County Business Profiles for 2021 to assess the most common types of small businesses by 2-digit NAICS (the North American Industry Classification System) code, as well as the total amount they spent on payroll (in $1000's of US dollars). </p>
